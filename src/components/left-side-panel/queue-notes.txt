<!-- Each audio tag can be a react component and represent each queued track on the left hand side. If another
track is clicked, the pause() function is called on the currently playing audio tag and the play() function
is called on the selected track. The queue of tracks on the left is reshuffled (selected to top and removed from queue).
All audio tags can be hidden all of the time. -->

<!-- Maybe use the oncanplay event to show loading spinner until enough has buffered it can play: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_eventattributes.asp -->
